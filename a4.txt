Q0 Find the top 10 users who got retweeted the most from other users (for this you need both files, use fgrep) (due to an Excel limitation that zeroes out the last digits in a long tweet ID, which was noticed by Vivian, this question was moved from A2 to A4).

$ for twid in $(awk -F '\t' '{print $5}' downloaded_tweets_extend_nolf2.tsv| grep type=retweeted  | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g'); do awk -F ' ' '{print $1, $2}' downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2.tsv|  grep ${twid} ;done | awk -F ' ' '{print $2}'|sort| uniq -c| sort -nr |head -10

Q1
repeat A3 for retweet
1) Represent influence between users as a directional graph of users, save as a list of lines
output format is like  " 'userID got retweeted'  'userID who retweet' "

$ awk -F '\t' '{print $5, $2}' downloaded_tweets_extend_nolf2.tsv| grep type=retweeted   |awk -F '[a-z=&\"]*'  '{print  $4, $5 }'|awk -F ' ' '{print $1,$3}'|sort -n > A4_q1.txt

Q2  Produce clusters (groups of influence) by ranking the users who got retweeted by their number of retweets. Keep only the largest clusters by "cutting" at a threshold of 3; in order words, keep just the graph for users who got 3 or more retweet

$ for twid in $(awk -F '\t' '{print $5}' downloaded_tweets_extend_nolf2.tsv| grep type=retweeted  | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g'); do awk -F ' ' '{print $1, $2}' downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2.tsv|  grep ${twid} ;done | awk -F ' ' '{print $2}'|sort| uniq -c| sort -nr | awk '{if($1>2) {print}}' > a4_q2.txt

Q3 Plot the sizes of clusters as a histogram to show how many clusters of each size resulted.
See a4_q3.svg
X-axis indicates number of people and Y-axis indicates number of retweet got.


Q4 Find the 30 most frequent hashtags in these largest clusters of retweet you kept (for the users/tweets that got retweeted, not the users/tweets doing the retweet.
$ for twid in $(awk -F '\t' '{print $5}' downloaded_tweets_extend_nolf2.tsv| grep type=retweeted  | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g'); do awk -F ' ' '{print $1, $5}' downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2.tsv|  grep ${twid} ;done | awk -F ' ' '{print $2}'|sort| uniq -c| sort -nr | head -30

Q5  Plot a network cluster you got for retweets and a cluster for replies (from this and the previous assignment) in a network visualization tool, such as Gephi. As shown here, you can input your csv relationships and plot them. 
Please see the png images

Q6 what the networks you plotted show?
For the retweet, you can see the network is very broad due to the inflence of function retweet, on the other hand, reply is more personal so network is narrower. For example, the user who got replied the most got 45 replies by some users, however, the user who got retweeted the most got 1076 retweets. The network between the users based on reply is more personal and small compared to the network betwen the users based on retweet.
